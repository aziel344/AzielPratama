    Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://ohmyposh.dev/install.ps1'))

This installs a couple of things:

    oh-my-posh.exe - Windows executable
    themes - The latest Oh My Posh themes

info

For the PATH to be reloaded, a restart of your terminal is advised. If oh-my-posh is not recognized as a command, you can run the installer again, or add it manually to your PATH. For example:

$env:Path += ";C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\bin"

Antivirus software

Due to frequent updates of Oh My Posh, Antivirus software occasionally flags it (false positive). To ensure Oh My Posh isn't blocked you can either report it to your favorite Antivirus software as false positive (e.g. Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft for analysis) or create an exclusion for it. Exclusions should be added with the full path to the executable, you can get it with the following command from a PowerShell prompt:

(Get-Command oh-my-posh).Source

Next

Now that Oh My Posh is installed, you can go ahead and configure your terminal and shell to get the prompt to look exactly like you want.

    install a font
    configure your terminal/editor to use the installed font
    configure your shell to use Oh My Posh
    (optional) configure a theme or custom prompt configuration
